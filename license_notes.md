# About the license

This fork was made after NPX silently left the community circa 2016-2017.

NPX originally licensed their code under "GPLv3" , then later switched it to "LGPL" without specifying a version.

## Choice of new license

[The Free Software Foundation's license compatibility matrix][1] indicates:

* any LGPL-licensed software can be directly redistributed under the GPLv3
* any `LGPLv2.1 or later` or `LGPLv3` can be distributed under LGPLv3

The most correct route would be to relicense directly under GPLv3 ; however given NPX's deliberate move from `GPLv3` to `LGPL`, it should be safe to assume `LGPLv2.1 or later` as the intended effect.

This software is thus now being licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later.
