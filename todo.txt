Mobs bugs + changes

* Ensure phoenix cannot burn through unswappable

Server-oriented changes

* Find a way to ensure that fire does not spread, without changing external mods...
    * exploding mobs use generic mobs_redo explode attack
    * mobs_redo uses tnt.explode which determines the fire type on its own
    * for now, this is on an ABM in fire mod - it may be that for NSSM deployment we will need to add a fire override mod...

API refactoring

* Split materials.lua into nodes, items, abms
    * in-progress

Cleanup + misc enhancements

* Make `_egg` marker consistent
    * Check if mobs are ever registered as items
    * Perhaps remove `_egg` designations altogether
    * Perhaps remove duck egg building recipes
