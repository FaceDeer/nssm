# Not So Simple Mobs

(C) 2016 NPX Team and Contributors , LGPLv2.1

NSSM adds a wide variety of very hostile mobs, as well as new weapons, armours and foods.

Ideal for single-player games !

The mobs are destructive of their environment, a server-oriented configuration will be added in due course.

This mod is a continuation of NPX Team's Not So Simple Mobs. Notes from the original README are available below.

## Some notes from NPX Team !

We suggest that you play nssm with:

* nssb (Not So Simple Buildings, our second mod that adds many blocks and Morlendor, the new dimension):
* `3d_armors` (with which you can use nssm armors):
* `unified_inventory` (useful to discover all the new recipes and to use the armors):
* a throwing mod (a mod that add bows) if compatible with the Tenplus1's `damage_system`

We would like to thank:

* PilzAdam, for his wonderful simple-mobs mod;
* Tenplus1, for his hard work in making `mobs_redo`;
* Echoes91, for Spears: simple but amazing;
* and obviously Celeron-55 and all the people who contributed to Minetest and its community (and Paramat in particular);
* Denise and `Ponzi_Duro` for the revision of the guide;
* `Double_P`, `Ponzi_Duro`, `Andrey01` and `Taikedz` for the beta testing;

The mod makes the game really hard, please read the wiki before playing: <http://wiki.minetest.net/Mods/Not_So_Simple_Mobs> (which will be updated as soon as possible) or the old guide for the 2.4 version.

Here are the trailers of the mod:
